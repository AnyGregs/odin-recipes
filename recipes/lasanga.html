    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasanga is one of Italy's most beloved dishes worldwide. Renowned for it's strong flavor and large portions, it has earned a reputation as one of the world's most foremost comfort foods.</p>
    <p>Thankfully making a lasanga is actually pretty simple, requiring only a few key ingredients and minimal prep time. Here is my recipe for a delicious and filling lasanga.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g prosciutoo</li>
        <li>tomato puree</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g pack fresh lasanga sheets</li>
        <li>white sauce</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella</li>
        <li>800g passata</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata and 200ml beef stock mixture. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180c/fan 160c/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (roughly 30cmx2cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasanga sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining white sauce, ensuring there isn't any pasta poking through.</li>
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on the top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
